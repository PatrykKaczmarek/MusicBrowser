## Coding guidelines

- Respect Swift [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- The code must be readable and self-explanatory - full variable names, meaningful methods, etc.
- Don't leave any commented-out code.

## About the project

The application isn't rocket science, and that's intentional. It has been created with an assumption that there is still some part of code using Objective-C. This implementation is encapsulated, so it doesn't leak outside to the newer parts of the app. 

**Requirements**:

- Implementation consists of two languages: `Objective-C` and `Swift`. This is intentional to show interoperability.
- UI is written mainly in `UIKit` with a small usage of `SwiftUI`.
- The application allows the user to add albums to favorites and store this information persistently on the device.
- User Interface design:
	- is pretty simple.
	- playlists should scroll vertically.
	- albums added to a playlist should scroll horizontally.
- API:
	- contains some minor issues. The app handles them gracefully.
